## Instructions

You are an information security expert specializing in security frameworks and control mapping.

For **EACH** SSCF control listed below, identify which CCM controls
address the same security requirement or capability. A "match" means the CCM
control substantively addresses the same security concern, even if scope or language differs.

**Target scope for this batch**: Only Families: A&A, AIS, BCR, CCC — 34 controls. Other target families are covered in separate batches.

### Confidence Levels — be precise
- **high**: The CCM control **directly and specifically requires** the same capability. The rationale must NOT use words like "partially," "broadly," "related to," or "touches on." If you need those words, it is medium, not high.
- **medium**: Partial overlap — the CCM control covers some but not all of the SSCF requirement, or addresses it at a broader scope.
- **low**: Tangential relationship only — shared vocabulary or domain but different actual requirements.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Keyword matching is not semantic matching.** The word "access" in a physical-security control does NOT match a logical-access control. "Audit" in a financial-audit context does NOT match security-audit logging. Read both controls fully before deciding.
- **Umbrella controls are not automatic matches.** A CCM control like "maintain a security program" is too broad to be a high match for a specific technical requirement. Mark it medium or low.

### Rules
- Include ALL relevant matches, even low confidence ones
- Set `unique_to_source` to `true` ONLY if there are NO high or medium matches **in this target group**
- Provide a one-sentence rationale for each match explaining the **specific** overlap
- If no matches exist in this target group, return an empty matches array

## SSCF Controls to Map

### CCC-SaaS-01
**Title**: Programmatic Configurations Querying
**Domain**: Change Control and Configuration Management - CCC
**Description**: The SaaS platform must support programmatic querying of all current security configurations.

If these concepts exist on the SaaS platform, they must be readable via programmatic querying:

1. Authentication
2. RBAC Assignments
3. Entitlements
4. Permissions
5. Resource ACLs
6. Application-specific security concepts
7. Configurations affecting security log coverage (e.g., enabling/disabling streams)
**Details**: Configurations include, but not limited to:
- Authentication
- RBAC Assignments
- Entitlements
- Permissions
- Resource ACLs
- Application-specific security concepts

All security configurations must be readable via API.
**Guidelines**: The output of the API should be in a machine-readable format.

### CCC-SaaS-02
**Title**: Configurations Documentation
**Domain**: Change Control and Configuration Management - CCC
**Description**: The SaaS platform must provide up-to-date documentation of all customer-visible, security-relevant configurations and must make it readily available to SaaS customers.

If these concepts exist on the SaaS platform, configuration documentation must include, but not be limited to:
1. Authentication
2. RBAC Assignments
3. Entitlements
4. Permissions
5. Resource ACLs
6 Application-specific security concepts
7. Audit configuration
**Details**: Configurations dDocumentation must include, but not limited to:
- Authentication
-RBAC Assignments
-Entitlements
-Permissions
-Resource ACLs
-Application-specific security concepts

Documentation must be readily available to SaaS administrators.
**Guidelines**: Documentation should be available via the SaaS provider’s website, within the platform, or community page. Public documentation is recommended.

Documentation should also include versioning and change logs to support traceability and audit requirements.

Any custom language or non-industry standard terms should be explained in detail.

Documentation should include: 
1. Security onboarding documentation. 
2. Focus on the impact of the security configuration.
3. Add default security settings, if applicable. Describe dependencies between configurations, such as one configuration overriding another.
4. Publish the customer responsibility matrix against the Shared Responsibility model, ensuring the customer is aware of what domain areas are supported by the SaaS platform.

### CCC-SaaS-03
**Title**: New Configuration Updates
**Domain**: Change Control and Configuration Management - CCC
**Description**: The SaaS platform must provide notifications about software updates, including new or existing security configuration options, to SaaS customers.
**Details**: New security configuration updates must be notified to SaaS administrators. and users.

They can’t be forced to SaaS administrator and users unless specific “strong” security breach urgency or with delay.

Notification can be made via email or dashboard/UI/release notes (RSS)/Webhook
**Guidelines**: Updates should have a subscribable mechanism that includes relevant release documentation and changes made to the SaaS platform.

It is recommended that console notifications are visible when these changes take place, in addition to a subscribable mechanism.

### CCC-SaaS-04
**Title**: Security Configuration Guidelines
**Domain**: Change Control and Configuration Management - CCC
**Description**: The SaaS platform must provide SaaS customers with best practice security guidelines for relevant security configurations of the SaaS platform and services.
**Details**: The inactive session timeout must allow SaaS administrators to set the inactive session timeout within the SaaS platform or the security configuration API.
**Guidelines**: Security Configuration Guidelines should consider best practices in domains like IDP configuration, interface configuration, principles like least privilege, secure SSO configuration, avoidance of long-lived sessions, and application policies.

The SaaS platform should create a subscribable mechanism that includes relevant changes.

Security Configuration Guidelines should be available via the SaaS provider’s website, within the platform, or community page.
