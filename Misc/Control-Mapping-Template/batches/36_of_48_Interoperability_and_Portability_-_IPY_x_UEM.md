# Batch: [36/48] Interoperability & Portability - IPY × Family: UEM
# Source: SSCF -> Target: CCM
# Controls in this batch: IPY-SaaS-01, IPY-SaaS-02
# Count: 2
# Target scope: Family: UEM

## Instructions

You are an information security expert specializing in security frameworks and control mapping.

For **EACH** SSCF control listed below, identify which CCM controls address the same security requirement or capability. A "match" means the CCM control substantively addresses the same security concern, even if scope or language differs.

**Target scope for this batch**: Only Family: UEM — 14 controls. Other target families are covered in separate batches.

### Confidence Levels — be precise
- **high**: The CCM control **directly and specifically requires** the same capability. The rationale must NOT use words like "partially," "broadly," "related to," or "touches on." If you need those words, it is medium, not high.
- **medium**: Partial overlap — the CCM control covers some but not all of the SSCF requirement, or addresses it at a broader scope.
- **low**: Tangential relationship only — shared vocabulary or domain but different actual requirements.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Keyword matching is not semantic matching.** The word "access" in a physical-security control does NOT match a logical-access control. "Audit" in a financial-audit context does NOT match security-audit logging. Read both controls fully before deciding.
- **Umbrella controls are not automatic matches.** A CCM control like "maintain a security program" is too broad to be a high match for a specific technical requirement. Mark it medium or low.

### Rules
- Include ALL relevant matches, even low confidence ones
- Set `unique_to_source` to `true` ONLY if there are NO high or medium matches **in this target group**
- Provide a one-sentence rationale for each match explaining the **specific** overlap
- If no matches exist in this target group, return an empty matches array

### Output Format
Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code fences, no extra text). The JSON object has one key per source control ID, with a `matches` array, `unique_to_source` boolean, and `gap_rationale` string. See each batch file for the exact example and save path.

## SSCF Controls to Map

### IPY-SaaS-01
**Title**: Export Capability
**Domain**: Interoperability & Portability - IPY
**Description**: If the SaaS platform offers mass data export functionality, it must allow SaaS administrators to disable this functionality for non-administrative users.
**Details**: (Intentionally Left Blank)
**Guidelines**: Export capability should be disabled by default for non-administrative users.

### IPY-SaaS-02
**Title**: Integration Attribution
**Domain**: Interoperability & Portability - IPY
**Description**: The SaaS platform must implement a mechanism to allow or deny connections based on the verified creator of the integration. 

When SaaS platform users are prompted to accept integrations (e.g., via a consent screen), the acceptance process must display at least one verifiable attribute of the application's creator, such as their email address domain. This verifiable ownership attribute must be visible both during the acceptance process and in the list of connected integrations, as stipulated in IAM-SaaS-06.

Verification of the integration creator must be performed by the SaaS platform using an application-appropriate mechanism.
**Guidelines**: An example of a SaaS platform-appropriate mechanism can be confirmed by the email address of the creator, or the domain used in the OAuth consent (for relevant flows).
