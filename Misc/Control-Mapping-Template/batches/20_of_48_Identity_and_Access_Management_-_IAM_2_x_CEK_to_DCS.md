## Instructions

You are an information security expert specializing in security frameworks and control mapping.

For **EACH** SSCF control listed below, identify which CCM controls address the same security requirement or capability. A "match" means the CCM control substantively addresses the same security concern, even if scope or language differs.

**Target scope for this batch**: Only Families: CEK, DCS — 39 controls. Other target families are covered in separate batches.

### Confidence Levels — be precise
- **high**: The CCM control **directly and specifically requires** the same capability. The rationale must NOT use words like "partially," "broadly," "related to," or "touches on." If you need those words, it is medium, not high.
- **medium**: Partial overlap — the CCM control covers some but not all of the SSCF requirement, or addresses it at a broader scope.
- **low**: Tangential relationship only — shared vocabulary or domain but different actual requirements.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Keyword matching is not semantic matching.** The word "access" in a physical-security control does NOT match a logical-access control. "Audit" in a financial-audit context does NOT match security-audit logging. Read both controls fully before deciding.
- **Umbrella controls are not automatic matches.** A CCM control like "maintain a security program" is too broad to be a high match for a specific technical requirement. Mark it medium or low.

### Rules
- Include ALL relevant matches, even low confidence ones
- Set `unique_to_source` to `true` ONLY if there are NO high or medium matches **in this target group**
- Provide a one-sentence rationale for each match explaining the **specific** overlap
- If no matches exist in this target group, return an empty matches array

### Output Format
Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code fences, no extra text). The JSON object has one key per source control ID, with a `matches` array, `unique_to_source` boolean, and `gap_rationale` string. See each batch file for the exact example and save path.

## SSCF Controls to Map

### IAM-SaaS-09
**Title**: User provisioning and deprovisioning
**Domain**: Identity & Access Management - IAM
**Description**: The SaaS platform must support automated user provisioning and deprovisioning.

The SaaS platform must have a mechanism to limit the programmatic access of user provisioning and deprovisioning operations.
**Details**: Control= View, Remove and reset all authentication factors associated to users, and user provisioned credentials
**Guidelines**: The suggested implementation is SCIM. Alternative programmatic methods, such as API calls, are also permissible.

### IAM-SaaS-10
**Title**: Security Auditing Role
**Domain**: Identity & Access Management - IAM
**Description**: The SaaS platform must provide a Security Auditing role for read-only access to all security settings, including log access in UI and via programmatic means.

The Security Auditing role must allow visibility into security configurations and logging data.  

It must not enable viewing or modifying customer data or making changes to any configurations.
**Details**: IP restriction is possible
**Guidelines**: This cell intentionally left blank

### IAM-SaaS-11
**Title**: Password Rules
**Domain**: Identity & Access Management - IAM
**Description**: The SaaS platform must define password strength requirements or configuration controls to comply with NIST guidelines.

If implemented through configuration controls, the following must be configurable:
1. Set Password length
2. Password reuse
3. Toggle Special Characters required
4. Password expiry
**Details**: Support programmatic user provisioning and deprovisioning. 

A mechanism to limit the programmatic access for just user provisioning and deprovisioning operations must exist
**Guidelines**: The SaaS platform can support password strength assessment, including already compromised passwords.

SaaS platform administrators should consider industry-wide accepted standards, such as NIST, while configuring this feature. 

This control applies to SaaS users and is not needed for users with delegated authentication (SAML)

### IAM-SaaS-12
**Title**: Multi-Factor Authentication
**Domain**: Identity & Access Management - IAM
**Description**: The SaaS platform must support the use of multi-factor authentication.

The SaaS platform must allow SaaS platform administrators to toggle on and off each factor.

The SaaS platform must have the capability to configure MFA enforcement (The user may not sign in without MFA).
**Details**: Access must allow visibility into security configurations and logging data.  

However, it must not enable viewing or modifying customer data or making changes to configurations.
**Guidelines**: It is recommended to disallow vulnerable MFA methods (such as SMS) and support phishing-resistant methods.

### IAM-SaaS-13
**Title**: Disabling Anonymous Access
**Domain**: Identity & Access Management - IAM
**Description**: If the SaaS platform supports anonymous access, it must provide a mechanism to disable it globally.
**Details**: Must be able to configure:
Set Password length

Toggle Special Characters required
password expiry
**Guidelines**: This cell intentionally left blank

### IAM-SaaS-14
**Title**: Disabling External Access for Unmanaged Users
**Domain**: Identity & Access Management - IAM
**Description**: If the SaaS platform supports access for external unmanaged users, it must provide a mechanism to disable it globally.
**Details**: Support for one MFA factor that is not SMS or email.

For each factor:
Setting to allow for toggle on/off

Has the capability to configure MFA enforcement (e.g.,i.e., user may not sign in without MFA).
**Guidelines**: External unmanaged users can also be referred to as guest users

### IAM-SaaS-15
**Title**: Session Revocation/ Single Sign Out
**Domain**: Identity & Access Management - IAM
**Description**: The SaaS platform must support a process to invalidate a user’s sessions via programmatic means.

Invalidation of the user session must have the capability to revoke user and application sessions (all device and UI sessions) in real-time.
**Details**: (Intentionally Left Blank)
**Guidelines**: This is commonly referred to as a universal log-out.

### IAM-SaaS-16
**Title**: Entitlements Change Enforcement
**Domain**: Identity & Access Management - IAM
**Description**: The SaaS platform must support immediate enforcement of entitlement changes. 

Where not possible, forced re-authentication is allowed.
**Details**: Invalidation of user session has the capability to revoke user and application access in realtime
**Guidelines**: The SaaS platform should provide session blocklisting.
