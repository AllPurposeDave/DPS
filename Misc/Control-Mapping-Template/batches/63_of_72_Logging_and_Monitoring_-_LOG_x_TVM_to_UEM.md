## Instructions

You are an information security expert specializing in security frameworks and control mapping.

For **EACH** SSCF control listed below, identify which CCM controls address the same security requirement or capability. A "match" means the CCM control substantively addresses the same security concern, even if scope or language differs.

**Target scope for this batch**: Only Families: TVM, UEM — 26 controls. Other target families are covered in separate batches.

### Confidence Levels — be precise
- **high**: The CCM control **directly and specifically requires** the same capability. The rationale must NOT use words like "partially," "broadly," "related to," or "touches on." If you need those words, it is medium, not high.
- **medium**: Partial overlap — the CCM control covers some but not all of the SSCF requirement, or addresses it at a broader scope.
- **low**: Tangential relationship only — shared vocabulary or domain but different actual requirements.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Keyword matching is not semantic matching.** The word "access" in a physical-security control does NOT match a logical-access control. "Audit" in a financial-audit context does NOT match security-audit logging. Read both controls fully before deciding.
- **Umbrella controls are not automatic matches.** A CCM control like "maintain a security program" is too broad to be a high match for a specific technical requirement. Mark it medium or low.

### Rules
- Include ALL relevant matches, even low confidence ones
- Set `unique_to_source` to `true` ONLY if there are NO high or medium matches **in this target group**
- Provide a one-sentence rationale for each match explaining the **specific** overlap
- If no matches exist in this target group, return an empty matches array

### Output Format
Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code fences, no extra text). The JSON object has one key per source control ID, with a `matches` array, `unique_to_source` boolean, and `gap_rationale` string. See each batch file for the exact example and save path.

3. Creating integrations, including into other SaaS platforms.
4. Creation, deletion, and/or modification of API keys.
5. OAuth access key generation using a refresh token.
6. User impersonation (including by local administrators or user-to-user role assumption).
7. Creation and modification of user accounts and their permissions
8. Each authentication step, including MFA stages and the factor used.
9. Bulk export and mass data reporting activity.

### LOG-SaaS-02
**Title**: Log Records Mandatory Fields
**Domain**: Logging and Monitoring - LOG
**Description**: The SaaS platform Logs must contain the following security-relevant information: 
1. Timestamp
2. User ID/username, or NHI ID (If applicable)
3. Impersonation user ID, whether from a customer or SaaS provider.
4. IP address
5. User agent (if applicable)
6. Source of change context (API/UI/App)
7. Action
8. Target resource
9. Non-sensitive session identifier

### LOG-SaaS-03
**Title**: Programmatic Logs Delivery
**Domain**: Logging and Monitoring - LOG
**Description**: The SaaS platform must support programmatic log delivery via a push or pull mechanism.

### LOG-SaaS-04
**Title**: Logs Retention
**Domain**: Logging and Monitoring - LOG
**Description**: The SaaS platform Logs must be retained and are available to customers.

Logs must be made available to the customer for a minimum of 7 days.

### LOG-SaaS-05
**Title**: Logs Delivery Latency
**Domain**: Logging and Monitoring - LOG
**Description**: The SaaS platform Logs must be delivered without undue delay or latency.

Logs must be made available and deliverable to or by the customer without undue delay, but at most within 24 hours.

### LOG-SaaS-06
**Title**: Log Events Documentation
**Domain**: Logging and Monitoring - LOG
**Description**: The SaaS platform must provide documentation for log events.

Log format, log types, and specific fields provided by the SaaS platform must be documented and accessible by customers.

### LOG-SaaS-07
**Title**: Log Integrity
**Domain**: Logging and Monitoring - LOG
**Description**: If the SaaS platform allows logs to be mutable, it must provide an administrative mechanism for logs to be made immutable.
